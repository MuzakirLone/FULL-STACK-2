# Experiment-6: Login Form with OAuth Verification

## Learning Outcomes

1. **React State Management**: Understanding and implementing `useState` hook to manage form inputs and application state in a functional component.

2. **DOM Manipulation in React**: Learning how to dynamically update the DOM by conditionally rendering messages based on user input and validation logic.

3. **Event Handling**: Implementing event handlers (`onChange`, `onClick`) to capture user interactions and trigger appropriate functions.

4. **Form Validation**: Creating client-side validation logic to verify user credentials and provide immediate feedback to users.

5. **Component Styling with CSS**: Applying modern CSS techniques including gradients, animations, transitions, and responsive design to create a visually appealing user interface.

6. **Controlled Components**: Implementing controlled form inputs where React state serves as the single source of truth for input values, ensuring synchronized data flow between the UI and application logic.
